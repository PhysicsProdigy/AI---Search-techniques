# AI Search-techniques
 
In my Intro to Artificial Intelligence subject, we learnt about brute force search algorithms. We implemented these techniques to our customised "Sydeney Trains" problem. There are things that we could've done to have a better A* search. The other algorithms work as intended. The Data is not included but the data processing folder is. 

Search libraries are copied from lab contents, but jupyter notebooks are our creations. 

We got our data from https://opendata.transport.nsw.gov.au/user-guide
